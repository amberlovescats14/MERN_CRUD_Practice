# MERN_CRUD_Practice
It has been 2 weeks since I made my last Full Stack App, so I am going to create one and use it as my portfolio.

I am not going to use BootStrap to style this, I may choose between ANT Design, MaterialUI, or TailWinds

Also this app will be public for employers, so there will be no authorization, I will rely on individuals to only edit and delete their own comments.

This app will include, a server, a database, Schemas, routes, React and Heroku.
